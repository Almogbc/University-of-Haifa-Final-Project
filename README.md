Each month we will catalouge our progress on the project as a journal.

*October 2022:

This was the first month of the project in which we needed to find our footing and think what our project wanted to be.

We knew we needed to approach an instructor to create a unique project. As the first candidate we tried contacting a few different university proffesors but to no avail until we found [insert name here] and after talking we got an outline of the project.

Next we knew we needed to create a Github repository to keep organized and so we did.
